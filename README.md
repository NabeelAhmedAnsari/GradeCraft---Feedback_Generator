That’s a great initiative! Having two specialized AI feedback generators is smart. Let's tackle it in parts:

---

## ✅ 1. 🔤 **Catchy Name Suggestions**

### ✍️ For Internal Assessment Feedback Generator

This is focused on rubric-based evaluations for teachers, right?

**Name Ideas:**

* **EvalMate** – your smart evaluation companion
* **GradeCraft** – crafted feedback for student assessments
* **InsightRubric** – AI-generated insights from rubrics
* **TeachTide** – automated feedback that flows
* **FeedbackForge** – turn rubrics into meaningful messages

---

### 📚 For Essay, Maths Problem, Science Report Feedback

This is more general-purpose across different domains.

**Name Ideas:**

* **SmartScribe** – feedback that understands writing and logic
* **ThinkCheck** – evaluates thinking and writing critically
* **EduSense AI** – educational feedback with sense
* **BrainBox Feedback** – AI that reads and reflects
* **MentorMind** – like a personal mentor for assignments

## ✅ 2. 📘 README File Structure

### Option: **Separate README for each**

**Why?** Because their purpose, scope, and usage are different. Keeps each repo clean and professional.

## ✅ Next Step

If you want:
- I can review your code and write **custom README.md** files based on the actual features you’ve written.
- You can paste the code or upload both project folders here (or just key files like `main.py`, `config.py`, and `app.py`)

Would you like to do that?
